            What follows is H. Rackham's translation, as printed in the Loeb Classical Library edition, with words at 
            least partially represented in Lorem ipsum highlighted:[8]
            
            [32] But I must explain to you how all this mistaken idea of reprobating pleasure and extolling pain arose.
             To do so, I will give you a complete account of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. No one rejects, dislikes or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage 
             from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure? [33] On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain. These cases are perfectly simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of choice is untrammeled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise man therefore always holds in these matters to this principle of selection: 
            he rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains.

             Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a 
             galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries,
              but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s 
              with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software 
              like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the 
              readable content of a page when looking at its layout.
               The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, 
               content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as 
               their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions 
               have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).It is a long established

               , sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like)Education is a purposeful activity directed at achieving certain aims, such as transmitting knowledge or fostering skills and character traits. These aims may include the development of understanding, rationality, kindness, and honesty. Various researchers emphasize the role of critical thinking in order to distinguish education from indoctrination. 
               Some theorists require that education results in an improvement of the student while others prefer a value-neutral definition of the term. In a slightly different sense, education may also refer, not to the process, but to the product of this process: the mental states and dispositions possessed by educated people. Education originated as the transmission of cultural heritage from one generation to the next. Today, educational goals increasingly encompass new ideas such as the liberation of learners, skills needed for modern society, empathy, and complex vocational skills.

               Types of education are commonly divided into formal, non-formal, and informal education. Formal education takes place in education and training institutions, is usually structured by curricular aims and objectives, and learning is typically guided by a teacher. In most regions, formal education is compulsory up to a certain age and commonly divided into educational stages such as kindergarten, primary school and secondary school. Nonformal education occurs as addition or alternative to formal education.[1] It may be structured according to educational arrangements, but in a more flexible manner, and usually takes place in community-based, workplace-based or civil society-based settings. Lastly, informal education occurs in daily life, in the family, any experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts may be considered educational, whether unintentional or intentional. In practice there is a continuum from the highly formalized to the highly informalized, and informal learning can occur in all three settings.[2] For instance, homeschooling can be classified as nonformal or informal, depending upon the structure.
               
               Regardless of setting, educational methods include teaching, training, storytelling, discussion, and directed research. The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy. Education is supported by a variety of different philosophies, theories and empirical research agendas.
               
               There are movements for education reforms, such as for improving quality and efficiency of education towards relevance in students' lives and efficient 
               problem solving in modern or future society at large, or for evidence-based education methodologies. A right to education has been 
               recognized by some governments and the United Nations.[a] Global initiatives aim at achieving the Sustainable Development Goal 4,
                which promotes quality education for all..</P>
